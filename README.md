### How to Play the Game
#### Objective
In each round, the game generates a random equation with one missing number, shown as ùë•. Your task is to solve for ùë• using basic arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), or multiplication(√ó).

#### Example Equations
Below are some examples of the types of equations you might encounter:
- ```2 Ôºã ùë• = 5```
- ```ùë• ‚àí 3 = -1```
- ```8 √ó ùë• = 40```

#### Answering Equations
Simply type your answer and press Enter to submit.
There is no time limit - you can answer as many questions as you like.

#### Game Response
After you submit an answer, the game responds instantly:  
‚úÖ If your answer is correct, it will be acknowledged and your score will increase by 1 point.<br>

## Technical Documentation

### Introduction
This document provides a technical overview of the Python-based terminal program, the Equation Game. It has been created for developers or reviewers with a basic understanding of Python and outlines the program's structure, core logic and key functions.

### File Structure
The Equation Game is organised into two main Python files:

- ```main.py```

  This script functions as the game launcher. It imports the ```play_game()``` function from ```game_functions.py``` and executes it when the script is run.
  
```
from game_functions import play_game
if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

- ```game_functions.py```

  This module contains the core logic of the game. It includes all the key features within functions such as generating random equations, prompting and validating user input, and tracking the player's score.
