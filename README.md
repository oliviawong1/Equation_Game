## User Manual

### Introduction
The Equation Game is a simple, interactive maths quiz that helps you practise basic arithmetic by solving equations with a missing value (ùë•), such as ```3 √ó ùë• = 12```. This beginner-friendly game runs in the terminal, keeps tracks of your score, and shows the correct answers after each question. No prior experience with Python or programming is required.

### How to Play the Game
#### Objective
In each round, the game generates a random equation with one missing number, shown as ùë•. Your task is to solve for ùë• using basic arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), or multiplication(√ó).

#### Example Equations
Below are some examples of the types of equations you might encounter:
- ```2 Ôºã ùë• = 5```
- ```ùë• ‚àí 3 = -1```
- ```8 √ó ùë• = 40```

#### Answering Equations
Simply type your answer and press Enter to submit.
There is no time limit - you can answer as many questions as you like.

#### Game Response
After you submit an answer, the game responds instantly:  
‚úÖ If your answer is correct, it will be acknowledged and your score will increase by 1 point.<br>
‚ùå If your answer is incorrect, the correct answer will be shown.

### Example Gameplay
```üî¢ Welcome to The Equation Game! üî¢  
Try to solve each equation by finding the value of ùë•.
Type 'quit' to stop the game.

Question 1: 2 √ó x = 12  
Please enter your answer or 'quit' to end game: 6
‚úÖ Correct! Score: 1/1

Question 2: x - 5 = 5  
Please enter your answer or 'quit' to end game: 9
‚ùå Incorrect! The answer was 10. Score: 1/2

Question 3: 8 + x = 10  
Please enter your answer or 'quit' to end game: quit

Thanks for playing! Final score: 1/2
Keep practising
Good try

## Technical Documentation

### Introduction
This document provides a technical overview of the Equation Game, a Python-based terminal program. It has been created for developers or reviewers with a basic understanding of Python and outlines the program's structure, core logic, and key functions.

### Table of Contents
- [File Structure](#file-structure)
- [Game Flow and Logic](#game-flow-andlogic)
- [Functions Overview](#functions-overview)

### File Structure
The Equation Game consists into two main Python files:

- ```main.py```

  This script functions as the game launcher. It imports the ```play_game()``` function from ```game_functions.py``` and executes it when the script is run.
  
```
from game_functions import play_game
if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

- ```game_functions.py```

  This module contains the core logic of the game. It defines the main logic through various functions, which is designed to handle a specific task such as:
  - Generating random equations
  - Prompting and validating user input
  - Evaluating player responses
  - Tracking and updating the player's score

<div align="right"><kbd><a href="#table-of-contents">‚Üë Back to top ‚Üë</a></kbd></div>


### Game Flow and Logic 
As outlined below, the Equation Game follows a straightforward terminal-based logic flow.

#### 1. Launching the Game
The game starts when main.py is executed. This calls the ``play_game()``` function from the```game_functions.py``` file, initiating the main game loop.

#### 2. Equation Creation
A random mathematical equation is generated involving basic arithmetic operations, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), or multiplication (√ó). The equation is then displayed ine the terminal for the user to solve.

#### 3. User Prompt and Input
The user is prompted to sovle the displayed equation and enter their answer via the terminal input.

#### 4. Input Validation and Feedback 
The program checks whether the user's input is numeric. If the input is invalid, the user is prompted to try again. Once a valid input is entered, it will compare the user input to the correct answer. 

Feedback is provided immediately to inform the user if their answer is correct or incorrect, along with the correct answer if incorrect.

#### 5. Scoring
The game keeps track of the user's score, whcih increase by 1 point for each correct answer. The current score with feedback is displayed after each round.

#### 6. Game Continuation or Exit  
After each round, the loop repeats until the user enters ```quit``` which ends the game with a final score and messgae based performance.
